# UniversalCard Click Handling - Debugging Review

## Current Status: Partially Working, UI State Issues

### What We Know Works ✅
1. **Click Detection**: UniversalCard correctly detects button clicks
2. **Event Propagation**: App.tsx receives the click callbacks
3. **Store Function Calls**: answerQuestion is now being called in the store
4. **Build System**: All code compiles and builds successfully

### What's Broken ❌
1. **UI State Updates**: Questions remain visible after answering
2. **State Transition Logic**: Cards aren't transitioning between question → completed → next question
3. **View Rendering Logic**: The display conditions aren't working as expected

---

## Architecture Overview

### Component Chain
```
UniversalCard (question mode)
├── onClick handler → onAnswer callback
└── App.tsx onAnswer → answerQuestion(store)
    └── Store updates answers{} and scores
        └── Should trigger UI re-render
```

### Key Files Modified
1. **UniversalCard.tsx**: Added debug logging, cleaned templates
2. **App.tsx**: Fixed onAnswer callback to actually call answerQuestion
3. **schema.ts**: Extended interfaces for flexible options
4. **store.ts**: Added debug logging to answerQuestion

---

## Current Data Flow Analysis

### Expected Flow
1. User clicks option → UniversalCard onClick
2. UniversalCard calls onAnswer(optionValue)
3. App.tsx receives onAnswer, calls answerQuestion(questionId, value)
4. Store updates answers{questionId: value} and recalculates scores
5. React re-renders based on new state
6. App.tsx checks if question is answered → should show completed mode or next question

### Suspected Issues

#### 1. **State-to-UI Mapping Problem**
```typescript
// In App.tsx - How does it know a question is "answered"?
const isAnswered = answers[question.id] !== undefined;

// But the rendering logic might not be checking this correctly
```

#### 2. **Mode Detection Logic**
```typescript
// UniversalCard expects mode prop, but how is App.tsx determining mode?
<UniversalCard 
  mode="question" // ← This might always be "question"
  // Should be: mode={isAnswered ? "completed" : "question"}
/>
```

#### 3. **Question Filtering Logic**
```typescript
// App.tsx might not be filtering out answered questions from current level
const currentQuestions = currentLevelData?.questions || [];
// Should be: currentQuestions.filter(q => !answers[q.id])
```

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: State Inspection
1. **Check Store State**: Add logging to see what's in `answers` object after click
2. **Check Rendering Logic**: Examine how App.tsx determines which questions to show
3. **Check Mode Logic**: Verify how UniversalCard mode is determined

### Phase 2: UI Rendering Logic
1. **Question Visibility**: Find the logic that determines which questions are rendered
2. **Mode Switching**: Find where/how cards transition from question → completed
3. **Progress Logic**: Verify how the app moves to next questions/levels

### Phase 3: Data Consistency
1. **Answer Format**: Ensure answer values match expected format (yes/no vs boolean vs optionId)
2. **Question IDs**: Verify question IDs in data match what's being stored
3. **State Shape**: Confirm store state matches what UI components expect

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Add State Inspection Logging
```typescript
// In App.tsx, log the current state after each render
console.log('Current answers:', answers);
console.log('Current questions being rendered:', currentQuestions);
```

### 2. Check Mode Determination Logic
```typescript
// Find where mode is set for UniversalCard
// Should be something like:
const mode = answers[question.id] ? 'completed' : 'question'
```

### 3. Verify Question Filtering
```typescript
// Check if answered questions are being filtered out
const unansweredQuestions = questions.filter(q => !answers[q.id]);
```

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **What's in the store after answering?** 
   - Is answers[questionId] being set correctly?
   - Are scores being recalculated?

2. **How does App.tsx decide what to render?**
   - Is it filtering answered questions?
   - Is it checking answer state for mode switching?

3. **What triggers the next question to appear?**
   - Is it automatic after answering?
   - Is there a separate "next" action needed?

4. **Are we mixing answer formats?**
   - Some places expect 'yes'/'no' strings
   - Others expect boolean true/false
   - Others expect optionId strings

## Files That Need Review

### Priority 1 - Core Rendering Logic
- `src/App.tsx` (lines ~500-520): Question rendering and mode logic
- `src/components/UniversalCard.tsx` (lines ~60-100): Mode-based rendering

### Priority 2 - State Management
- `src/features/assessment/state/store.ts` (answerQuestion function)
- `src/features/assessment/engine/schema.ts` (data type consistency)

### Priority 3 - Data Integration
- Question data structure and IDs
- Answer value formats and expectations

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add comprehensive state logging** to see what's happening after answers
2. **Trace the rendering logic** to find where mode/visibility decisions are made
3. **Test with simplified data** to isolate the UI logic from data complexity
4. **Create a minimal reproduction** with a single question to verify the flow

This will help us systematically identify where the disconnect between "answer stored" and "UI updated" is occurring.
