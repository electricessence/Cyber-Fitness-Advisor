# Question Authoring Guide

## Overview

Questions are the heart of the Cyber Fitness Advisor experience. This guide covers how to create engaging, impactful security assessment questions that follow our "quick wins first" philosophy.

## Question Schema

### Basic Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "type": "YN" | "SCALE",
  "weight": 1-10,
  "text": "Your question here?",
  "quickWin": boolean (optional),
  "timeEstimate": "2 minutes" (optional),
  "explanation": "Why this matters..." (optional),
  "actionHint": "How to do this..." (optional)
}
```

### Field Definitions

#### `id` (required)
- **Format**: Lowercase, underscore-separated
- **Pattern**: `{domain}_{concept}` or `{domain}_{concept}_{variant}`
- **Examples**: `acct_mfa`, `device_encryption`, `backup_frequency`
- **Must be globally unique across all domains**

#### `type` (required)
- **`"YN"`**: Yes/No questions for binary security practices
- **`"SCALE"`**: 1-5 scale for behavioral/frequency questions
- **Choose YN for**: "Do you use X?", "Is Y enabled?"
- **Choose SCALE for**: "How often do you...?", "How careful are you...?"

#### `weight` (required)
- **Range**: 1-10 (integers only)
- **Guidelines**:
  - **9-10**: Critical security fundamentals (MFA on banking, password manager, backups)
  - **7-8**: Important security practices (device encryption, antivirus, regular updates)
  - **5-6**: Good security hygiene (unique passwords, safe browsing)
  - **3-4**: Advanced or situational practices (VPN usage, network segmentation)
  - **1-2**: Minor improvements or very specific scenarios

#### `quickWin` (optional)
- **When to use**: High security impact + Low effort/time + Immediate benefit
- **Criteria for Quick Win**:
  - ✅ Can be completed in 10 minutes or less
  - ✅ Provides substantial security improvement
  - ✅ Uses built-in tools or free services
  - ✅ Doesn't require technical expertise
  - ❌ Avoid for: Complex configurations, paid services, organizational changes

#### `timeEstimate` (optional but recommended for Quick Wins)
- **Format**: Natural language time descriptions
- **Examples**: "1 minute", "5 minutes", "10 minutes", "30 seconds"
- **Guidelines**:
  - Be realistic - test the time estimate yourself
  - Include time to find the setting, not just to toggle it
  - Round up rather than down to avoid frustration

#### `explanation` (optional but recommended)
- **Purpose**: Help users understand WHY this matters
- **Length**: 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Focus on**: Risk mitigation, real-world impact, peace of mind
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "Prevents unauthorized access if you walk away from your device"
  - ✅ "Your email is the key to password resets for all other accounts"
  - ❌ "According to NIST framework 2.0 authentication guidelines..."

#### `actionHint` (optional but recommended)
- **Purpose**: Tell users HOW to implement this
- **Format**: Specific, actionable steps
- **Be platform-agnostic when possible**
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "Go to Settings > Update & Security > Turn on automatic updates"
  - ✅ "Install uBlock Origin from your browser's extension store"
  - ❌ "Configure your security settings appropriately"

## Writing Effective Questions

### Question Text Guidelines

#### 1. Be Clear and Direct
```json
// ✅ Good
"Do you have automatic updates enabled on your devices?"

// ❌ Too vague  
"Are your systems configured for optimal patch management?"
```

#### 2. Use Everyday Language
```json
// ✅ Good
"Do you use different passwords for different accounts?"

// ❌ Too technical
"Have you implemented unique credential policies across authentication domains?"
```

#### 3. Focus on Behavior, Not Knowledge
```json
// ✅ Good - tests actual behavior
"Do you check for the lock icon (HTTPS) when entering sensitive information?"

// ❌ Knowledge test
"Do you know what HTTPS means?"
```

#### 4. Make the Scope Clear
```json
// ✅ Good - specific scope
"Is 2FA enabled on your main email account?"

// ❌ Too broad
"Do you use 2FA?"
```

### Scale Questions (1-5)

For SCALE questions, define the scale clearly:

#### Frequency Scales
```json
{
  "text": "How often do you backup important data? (1=Never, 5=Daily/Automatic)",
  "type": "SCALE"
}
```

#### Behavior Scales  
```json
{
  "text": "How careful are you with email attachments? (1=Open everything, 5=Very cautious)",
  "type": "SCALE"
}
```

#### Quality/Compliance Scales
```json
{
  "text": "What percentage of your accounts use unique passwords? (1=None, 5=All)",
  "type": "SCALE"
}
```

## Question Organization

### Domain Structure

Each domain should progress logically through security maturity:

#### Level 0: Essential Basics
- Focus on **quick wins** with maximum impact
- Built-in tools and free services
- 2-10 minute time commitments
- Universal applicability

#### Level 1: Building Good Habits  
- Slightly more effort or time investment
- May require downloading free tools
- 10-30 minute time commitments
- Reinforces Level 0 practices

#### Level 2: Advanced Protection
- Specialized tools or configurations
- May require some technical comfort
- 30+ minute time commitments  
- Situational based on user needs

### Example Domain Progression

**Account Security Domain:**
```json
{
  "id": "account",
  "title": "Account Security",
  "levels": [
    {
      "level": 0,
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "email_mfa",
          "type": "YN", 
          "weight": 10,
          "quickWin": true,
          "timeEstimate": "5 minutes",
          "text": "Is two-factor authentication enabled on your main email?"
        },
        {
          "id": "browser_passwords", 
          "type": "YN",
          "weight": 8,
          "quickWin": true,
          "timeEstimate": "3 minutes",
          "text": "Do you let your browser save and generate passwords?"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "level": 1,
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "password_uniqueness",
          "type": "SCALE",
          "weight": 7, 
          "text": "What percentage of accounts use unique passwords? (1=None, 5=All)",
          "actionHint": "Use your browser's password generator for new accounts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Positive user experience

#### Poor Questions  
- Vague or confusing language
- Weight doesn't match impact
- Missing context or instructions
- Unrealistic expectations
- Technical jargon

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. The "Perfect Security" Trap
❌ Don't ask about enterprise-grade security for home users
❌ Don't require paid services or specialized hardware
✅ Focus on practical, achievable improvements

### 2. The "Knowledge Test" Trap
❌ "Do you know what phishing is?"
✅ "How often do you verify sender identity before clicking email links?"

### 3. The "Overwhelm" Trap  
❌ Don't start with complex, time-intensive tasks
✅ Build momentum with quick, satisfying wins

### 4. The "Guilt Trip" Trap
❌ "Are you recklessly endangering your data by not using enterprise backup solutions?"
✅ "Do you backup important files like photos and documents?"

## Contribution Process

1. **Research**: Verify security impact and implementation effort
2. **Draft**: Write questions following this guide
3. **Test**: Validate time estimates and instructions  
4. **Review**: Check against quality criteria
5. **Submit**: Create pull request with clear rationale

### Updating Existing Questions
- Preserve question `id` to maintain user progress
- Update `weight` if security landscape changes
- Refresh `actionHint` if tools/methods improve
- Add `quickWin` flag if processes become easier

### Question Retirement
- Mark as deprecated rather than deleting
- Provide migration path for user progress
- Document reason for retirement

Remember: Great questions balance security impact with user experience. They should make users feel empowered and successful, not overwhelmed or inadequate.
