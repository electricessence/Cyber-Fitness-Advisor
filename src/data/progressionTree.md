# Cyber Fitness Advisor - User Progression Tree

## Design Principles
- **NO SHAME**: Never make users feel bad about current practices
- **POSITIVE FRAMING**: Focus on what they CAN do, not what they're missing
- **CONFIDENCE BUILDING**: Start with easy wins and positive reinforcement
- **CURIOSITY DRIVEN**: Questions should feel like discovery, not judgment

## Progression Categories

### ðŸŒ± **Discovery Phase** (First Interaction)
**Goal**: Learn about user without judgment, build curiosity

**Potential First Questions** (Non-shaming):
- "What's your main device for browsing the internet?" (factual, neutral)
- "Which of these activities do you enjoy most online?" (positive framing)
- "What would you like to feel more confident about online?" (aspirational)
- "How comfortable are you with trying new apps or settings?" (self-assessment without judgment)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Opportunity Identification** 
**Goal**: Find easy wins based on what they already do

**Categories**:
1. **Existing Strengths** - What are they already doing well?
   - "Do you already use a password for your phone/computer?" (builds on existing habit)
   - "Have you ever updated an app?" (builds on existing behavior)

2. **Low-Hanging Fruit** - Easy additions to current habits
   - Browser settings they can improve
   - Built-in features they might not know about
   - Simple one-click improvements

3. **Natural Extensions** - Building on what they're comfortable with
   - If they use banking apps â†’ talk about account security
   - If they shop online â†’ talk about safe browsing
   - If they use social media â†’ talk about privacy settings

### ðŸš€ **Momentum Building**
**Goal**: Chain small wins together

**Categories**:
1. **Foundation Layer** (Essential but feels easy)
   - Software updates (often just clicking "yes")
   - Basic browser security (built-in features)
   - Strong authentication (where they already use passwords)

2. **Protection Layer** (Proactive defense)
   - Ad blockers (improves experience + security)
   - Secure DNS (invisible improvement)
   - Backup strategies (peace of mind)

3. **Advanced Layer** (For confident users)
   - Network security
   - Advanced privacy tools
   - Incident response

### ðŸŽ® **Gamification Elements**

**Positive Reinforcement**:
- "Security Habits Discovered" instead of "Vulnerabilities Found"
- "Protection Level Unlocked" instead of "Risk Reduced"
- "Digital Confidence Boosted" instead of "Attack Surface Minimized"

**Progress Visualization**:
- Personal security shield strength
- Confidence meter
- Skills unlocked
- Protection achievements
